NLP to SQL Converter

Overview
This project implements a rule-based Natural Language to SQL converter for a dedicated employee database. 
It converts restricted natural language employee queries into SQL SELECT statements.

Database
The system targets a fixed employee table with columns:
id, name, department, salary, hire_date, city, age

Sample data is provided in database/employees.csv.

Approach
The converter uses simple rule-based parsing. It cleans and standardizes the user input, checks that 
the command matches the expected pattern, extracts any filter conditions, verifies the column names against 
the employee schema, and then builds the corresponding SQL query.

Supported Query Structure
The system supports natural language queries of the form:

show employees  
show employees where column op value  
show employees where column op value and column op value  

Supported Operators
is  → equality  
=   → equality  
>   → greater than  
<   → less than  

Features Implemented
- Employee listing queries
- WHERE clause parsing
- Multiple conditions using AND
- Column validation against schema
- Numeric vs text value handling
- SQL query construction

Example Conversions
Input: show employees  
Output: SELECT * FROM employees;

Input: show employees where salary > 50000  
Output: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

Input: show employees where department = sales and city = chennai  
Output: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'sales' AND city = 'chennai';
