NLP to SQL Converter

Overview
This project converts restricted natural language employee queries into SQL SELECT statements for a fixed employee database.

Database
The system targets a dedicated employee table with columns:
id, name, department, salary, hire_date, city, age

Sample data is available in database/employees.csv.

How It Works
The converter uses simple rule-based parsing.  
It normalizes the input text, checks that the command matches the expected pattern, extracts any filter conditions, validates column names against the employee schema, and builds the corresponding SQL query.

Supported Queries
show employees  
show employees where column op value  
show employees where column op value and column op value  
show employees order by column [asc|desc]  
show employees where ... order by ...

Operators Supported
is, =, >, <, >=, <=, !=  
Natural forms: not, is not

Processing Steps
1. Normalize input (lowercase, clean spaces)
2. Detect base command (show employees)
3. Parse WHERE conditions (if present)
4. Validate column names
5. Parse ORDER BY (if present)
6. Construct final SQL

Design Choices
- Fixed schema for predictable parsing
- Rule-based logic (no external NLP libraries)
- Column validation to prevent invalid SQL
- Supports filtering and sorting in natural language
